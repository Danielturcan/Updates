<p>This is the Tesla model 3 Tesla’s Models S and Model X are premium products with list prices to match; superior electric vehicles for the wealthy. The Model 3, now delivering to its first US owners (UK buyers must wait until late 2018 or, more likely, 2019), isn’t cheap but it’s considerably more affordable. UK pricing is yet to be set but is likely to start at a shade over £30,000.

For that you get a five-seat saloon with a single e-motor driving the rear wheels, Autopilot self-driving readiness, a starkly minimalist interior and a compelling turn of speed: 5.6sec 0-60mph and 130mph, despite weighing 1610kg.

The launch of an important new model – a new Ford Fiesta, BMW 5-series or Ferrari – makes a cover story for CAR and other specialist magazines. But the first deliveries of the Model 3 made full-page news stories in broadsheets around the planet. Why? We didn’t learn much more about the Model 3 from the event at the factory in Fremont, California, where the first 30 customers (all Tesla staff) got their cars. The test drives for journalists were extremely limited. And wise industry owl Bob Lutz pointed out that as those first deliveries were to employees, not customers, and so are more akin to the late-stage prototypes which major car makers give to their workers to shake out the final bugs before paying customers get theirs. 

But the world analyses Tesla founder Elon Musk’s every burp. Such is the market’s faith in his ability to predict and create the future that, despite building only 84,000 cars in 2016 Tesla is America’s most valuable car maker, with a market capitalisation of $53 billion (£39bn). That’s slightly greater than GM’s and a quarter more than Ford’s. If GM or Ford launched a new model which quintupled their sales, that would lead the news too. 

The markets’ reaction to the Model 3 was downbeat, but that’s to be expected. Tesla’s value is based on the anticipation of glittering future success. Its actual achievements – like delivering the first Model 3 – will at best meet the markets’ expectations. In this case, investors thought Musk sounded ‘squeamish’ about the challenges of building so many cars, and the share price slipped around 3%.

As with the S and X, slipping behind the wheel of Tesla’s newest EV feels like sliding into the future, thanks in part to its shockingly minimalist interior: a 15-inch touchscreen panel proudly signals an all-digital interface, and access is keyless and granted via smartphone. Perhaps in a few years such tech will seem as dated as a Nokia flip-phone, but right now the Model 3 is the new iPhone of the motoring world, a package of must-have features wrapped in a sleek, designer pod.
